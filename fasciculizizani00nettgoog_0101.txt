mediaeval spelling, Ι regret to find that Ι have, especially
in the first two or three sheets, allowed some traces
of the original writing to escape. I believe that the
line, which must of course be. drawn wherever the
received classical orthography is adopted, between mero
variatione of orthography and distinct forms of words

their correction would require the most intimate know·
