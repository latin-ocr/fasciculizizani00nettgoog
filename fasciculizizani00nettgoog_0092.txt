1110 collection was a fragment of a history 01 the Lol-
lards written hy an earlier hand Who this earlier
writer was it 10 impossible 10 do more than conjecture;
hut what evidence there is points to the name of
Stephen Patryngton. ·

In the first place Patryngton was, aa we have seen,
an early friend and patron of Walden, and his pre·
decwor as provincial of the Carmelite order ;“ he was
0100 the successor 01 Ouningham in the same office3
circumstances which tally well with the undue promi-
nence given to Ouningham in the narrative, and with
the papem having passed into Walden’s possession.
Fnrther, in the royal letter given at p. 316, Patryng·
ton is spoken 01 as 11 he had been second only to
Stokys in his activity against the Lollards3 and yet
the narrator, eye-witness as he certainly was, makes
no mention of him. Moreover, the letter 011110 four
claustra] orders 10 the duke 01 11000001011 10 0011110
be Per Pclrycptora, that 10, drawn up by him.
Patryngtcn, therefore, was in Oxford in the year 1382,
and it is observabis 'that the 001110 partiality 10 the
duke which 10 shown by that letter appears everywhere
in the narrative.

· On 1110 whole, then, it seems probable that Patryng·

perhaps, collected 1110 110010 as far as p. 411, up to

which point they 101111 0 nearly regular chronological

and 00010 years afterwards gave his papers to Walden.8
