Ralph de Ferrers, entered the sacred procincta with forty
armed men, killed Hanle on the spot, and took Schakel
back by force to his prison

Terror at the wild outrage seems to have been the first
feeling oi the bishops ; but at length the archbishop

‘¹ de conservando cuicunque legio suo justitiam per·
“ iniserit; in tantum quod audivimus eum dicere‘quod
“tolerabile foret ut perfugi haberent ibi refugium in
“ eausa alicujus speciei criminis laesae regiae majestatis.
“ Sed longe habet a proditione regni, a defensione in-
τ’ juriae Dei cx proximi, et etiam a damnatione animae
