a part of Wyclif’s theory of dominion„ That theory
was promulgated by the reformer in Oxford only a
few months after the disputed nominatior to the war-
denship‚ and it was hintcd at, probably two or three
years before, in his public discussions with Onningham.
th can suppose that 6110 promulgator was himself
the wardenl .

VII. One more presumption isden'ved from a leave
of absence obtained by the reformor, April 13, 1368,
101 two years, from his living of Fylingham. “ insis-

This expression seems scarcely suitable to the cir·
cumstanoes of a head of a house. Moreover‚ while
extensione of leave of absence are frequently noted as
such, this is worded as if it were a new licence But
Wyclif'a residence on his living does not seem oom-
patible, at least at such a time, with his being werden
of Canterbury Hall The value of this evidence is,
however, seriously diminiehed by the carelessness of thc
old registers.

VIII. Α far more cogent argument is the following.
The reformor was a doctor of divinity, at the very latest,
in 1366, and before that was a bachelor of divinity
for some time.⁹ In December 1366 the worden of
Canterbury Hall in his deed of appointment is styled
master of arts3 and in the statement of his cause before
the papal court, which must be dated 1368 01 1369,
110 is spoken of as a bachelor of divinity; that is to
say, at a time when the reformor was a doctor, of at
the least two, and probably of five or six years'
standing.

III But while this evidence seems to preclude the
possibility of tha wardon having been the reformor,
there is a direct probability that he was the vicar of
