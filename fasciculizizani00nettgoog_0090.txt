William Whyte’s examination¹ At that trial Walden

himself was present, and as it took place only two
yeara before his death, the closing of the collection at

which Walden was nearly interested, and especially by
the presence, in the list of Wyolif's heresias presented
to the council of Constance, of four articles, not con·
