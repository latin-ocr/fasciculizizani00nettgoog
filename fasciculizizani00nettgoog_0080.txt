Το this theory was attached a corollary which struck
at the foundation of the views then universally re·
oeived as to the relations of the spiritual and temporal
power. “ Lcrd, here are two awords,'' the spiritual
and the temporal—the one above, the other beneath-
the one to command, the other to execute—was the
doctrine of that memorablc aermon in which Becket laid
the foundation of a quarrel with his sovereign. There
is but one vicar of Christ upon earth, supreme by the
nature of his office ov'er every earthly authority, was
the doctrine which the court of Rome was steadily en·
deavouring to impose upon Western Christendom, a doc·
trine evaded indeed, like every other, by the passione
and the interests both of individuale and of natione,
but still as little to he questioned as any other portion
of the Catholic saith The doctrine of the reformer
was that the sovereignty thus claimed had never
been delegated to any man; that (lod had allotted
only portione ol dominion, particular fiefs, so to
speak, to each. And if any one were to be held
to be Christ's vicar upon earth-a term which he
did not refuse to apply to the pope-the title was
equally applicahle to the temporal as to the spiri-
tual chief. The king was the minister, the vicar of

God in things tempornL and was, therefore, as much ’

bound by his office to see that tempora] goods were

not waeted or misapplied hy the clergy, as the clergy
were to direct the spiritual affairs of the king. But

it was no part of Wyclif's intention to lower the power
of the clergy in what he considered their legitimate
