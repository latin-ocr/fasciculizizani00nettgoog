A denotes 1111 original manuscript, wherever others
hove been compared thrc 11 is the only authority,

· it is referred 11 in the notes 11 MS.

B is Bodl. 703, and 11111111, with other 111111,
Wyclif's confession, Tyssington's confession, and the
Conclusions condemned by the council 11 1382, with
1 1111 11 the members. Unlike A, it seems to be 1
11111111 copy from good origincls. It obounds in 111111·
'positions of words, evidently 111 11111111111, and carried
to such 11 extent that 1 have thought best not to
give them in the notes, except where they could be
possibly supposed 11 effect the sense, otherwise hardly 1
sentence 11 Tyssington’s 11111 would hove been without
1 note 11 the kind. It occasionally drops words, sls03
but it is not without good readings. ⁰

11 Gregory XI. (p. 212), Wyclif's Protcst (p. 245), and
the 11111 No. 111. in the Appendix. The first 11 these
is in 1 small, clear hand, much controcted It is, on
the whole, the best copy 11 the tract3 but it drops
words very frequently, und the transcriber seems 1111·
sionnlly 11 hove misread the contruction in his original.
