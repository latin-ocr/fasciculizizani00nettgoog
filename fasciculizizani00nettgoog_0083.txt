priesthood· In the high value they set on this
meteres praesag, ane in erae none, arey could‘
truly claim the authority of Wyolif. To this mixed
character 01 the Lollards even the few papers con-
tained in this volume bear decisive testimony.

On the miscellaneous documenta a few notes will
suffice :-

1. Those relative 10 Swynderby are printed in pseudo·
Knighton, 001 2668, 'but too 1110001110101)1 10 be worth
collation The chroniole, however, adds to them a
curions narrative. Wilkins¹ prints a prohibition 01
Archhishop Courtney’s against hearing Swynderby’s
(Skynderbye) preaching, dated May 4, 1391; and Foxe
gives some proceedings 01 the bishop 01 Ηο1010111
against him in July and August 01 the same year.

2. The proceedings against Orompe hy the bishop 01
Meath in 1384 and in the council of Stanford in
1392 010 not, I believe, noticed elsewhere.

3. The Lollard conclusione 01 1395 010 given by
Foxe, who states that he took them from the royal
archivea The independence 01 the two sources thus
confirma the date. They are also printed by Wilkins.

4. The doemnents relating to Richard Wyche appear
to be new.

5. 01 Lavingham's collection 01 Purvey's errore a
translation has been given by Fore. His recantation
forms part 01 the documents printed by Wilkins,
Concilio, 111. p. 260. The date 01 Lavingham's tract,
or rather 01 the Ecclesiae Regimen, on which it is
grounded‚ is incidentallya matter 01 some interest.
The editors 01 the Wyoliffite version 01 the Bihle²

have assigned 10 ita date previous 10 1396, in reli-
anoe on a statement 01 Fore, already quoted³ 11
