Luwls, John, Mn„ Minister of Margate.

The history of the life and sufferings of Dr. John Wiolif,
together with a collection of papers relating to the same
history. 8v0. London‚ 1720.

This book was reprinted at Oxford‚ 1820, with some 01
Mr. Lewis’s own corrections. The edition is not, however,
at all creditable to the University prees. There was moro
than one intermediate edition. As a literary performaneo
Lewis’s book is very poor, but it shows considerable know·
ledge of the reformer’e English worlrs, and has a very good

’ collection of documenta in the Appendix. Itis no light
praise to say that this, the first professed Life of Wyelif,
remains still the best.
