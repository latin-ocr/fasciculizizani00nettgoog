In the expression of the earliest heresies which our
author lays to his charge a general adherencc to the
same school is observahle, though many of the phrases
cre referahle irmediately to St Augustine, of whom
preeminently, in his later days, Wyclif was considered
a disciple¹ .

In the first place, Wyclifs doctrine as to the nature
of God is essentially Augustinian, and rests upon two
principles, which are familiar to the readers of the
great Latin doctor. The first is, that evil has no sub
stantive existence, but is simply the absence of good,
as darkness is the absence of light. The second is that
everything which exista, has three modes of existence;
the first, in'its idea in the Divina mind; the second,
in its second causes; and the third, in its individual
being.

Admitting, indeed, cs hc did, that it follows from our
conception of the Deity as infinite, that there is a sense
in which Godis everything‚ he was bound to explain
how this was consistent with the existence of evil,
sud with the coexistence of a personsd (lod, and personal
creaturos. Το the first of these difficulties he irnagined
that he found a sufficient answer in the negative cha-
racter of evil; the second he met hythe distinction
between the different modes of existence. God was
everything, he said, eccaadcm esse intelligibile, by
virtue of the presence of the ideas in the Divine
mind; but not in their actual being, secandam cece
ceietcee.

So again hie doctrine as to the Incarnation of our
Lord, which is here spoken of as heretical, is precisely
that of St. Angustiae, in the more defined shape given
