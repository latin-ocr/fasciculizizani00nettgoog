x INTRODUC'I'ION.

Wyclif, has extracted some of the documents,¹ which
have been reprinted hy Dr. Rohert Vaughan?

As the only cotemporary account of the risc of
the Lollards, it well deserves the attention which it
has received3 but it cau scarcely bc mlled a regular
chronicle, still less a history of the sect. The docu-

connected hy a narrative which, though broken and
inconsecutive, is evidently authentic, and of great velue:
but from the death of Wyclif, or more strictly from
the Ocuncil of London, to the close of the book in
1428, the original papers arc given without comment
or connection. We propose tc pass rapidly over the
ground, supplying, where we are able, the connecting
links necessary for understanding' the narrative, and
where that narrative cesses altogether, contenting our·
salves with a few isolated remarks on the documenta
