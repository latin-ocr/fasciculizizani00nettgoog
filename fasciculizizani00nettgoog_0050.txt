of the motives and conduct of the duke in an affair
of considerable importanoe¹

In one of the Spanish campaigns of the Black
Prinoe„ two esquireu named Haule and Sehakel, had
taken prisoner the Count de Denia, a mhtion of the
reigning house of Castile He had agreed to pay a
oertsin ransom, and returning to Spain had left his
eldoet son as a hostsge in his place. John of Gaunt,
who in right of his wife was now laying claim ιο
the crown of Castile, found that the possession of

the young count’s person would aid his design. He
therefore offered the esquires a price for their
prisoner, which was refused Foiled in this, he put

forward some claims, we scarcely know what, on the
part of the crown; and demanded that in the meantime
the prisoner, who was the subject of litigation, should
be secured in the lower. He again met with a refusal.
He then procured an aet of parliament ordering the
committel of Haule and Schakel ιο the tower if the
prisoner were not produced This was, as we have said,
in the session of 1377. But hc was destined still to
be haffled. The young count, from loyalty either to
his native sovereign or his captore, remain concealed
on parole, and Haule and Schakel went ιο the tower.
The resistanco was thoroughly English: respectful ιο
the law, but unflinching. The duke must have incurred
intense unpopularity, and was as far from his object
as ever.

Soon aster, however, the two prisonem appear to
have become alarmed for their safety. They escapcd
from the toust, and took sanctuary at Westminster.
Το thc sanctuary‚ accordingly, the duke followed them.
