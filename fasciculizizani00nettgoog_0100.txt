bound especially ιο defer, that Ι should present in the
text the reading of the best manuscript, whichever it
might be, and give the various readings of the others
in the notes While taking upon myself the respon·
sibility of not following this advice, on the ground that
no one of my manuscripts was sufficiently good to
serve as a standard, Ι have, in the latter partos the
volume, so far modilied the principles on which Ι had
begrm, as to retain in the text the reading which had
the best manuscript authority, wherever it left the
sentence intelligible. One example, out os many,
may serve to explain the difference. Wyclif's first
conclusion, p. 245, begins thus z-“ Totum genus lvn-
eranam concurrentium, etc.’' The two best MSS, via,
O, V, read humanum3 the third, A, reads hominum.
Had this occurred in the earlier partos the volume,
I should have placed hominum in the text, humanum
in the notes. As it isI have retained, in deference
to the MSS, what I feel sure is the wrong reading}
For the punctuation and the numbers at the heads
of the arguments in the controversial tracts I am
entirely responsible, though in a few marked cases, where
the stopping of the MS. seemed designed to change
the sense, this is pointed out in the netes. In
the references to the Bible the verse bas every-
where been added to the quotation os the chapter.
As the volume was originally prepared for the presa,
the orthography of the manuscript was preserved
throughout, and the early sheets were already in the

printer’s hands when instructions were received to
reduce it to the ordinary classical standard The

change had, therefore, to be made on the proof sheets3
