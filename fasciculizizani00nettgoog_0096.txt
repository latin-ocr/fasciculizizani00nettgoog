D is Harl. 31, 5, in the British Museum, and contains.
Wynterton's Absolutio. Itis the worst manuscript with
which Ι have had to deal. The omissione are so con- ¹
siderable, extending in some passages to several lines
together, as to give the impression of a fraudulent
attempt to abridgc the labour of transcription. But
for some three or four readings, it might be supposed
to be a bad copy of Ε, the mistakes of which it almost
invariably follows. '

Eis Reg. 7, n. 111. It contains, with other tracte,
Wyclif’s Confessiom Wynterton’s Absolutio, and the
. Conclusions condemned in 1382. In quality it ranks
next to D. The readings are generally poor, and the
omissione frequent

F is Reg. 8, u. ΧΗ. It contains the recantatione of
Purvey (p. 400) and Wyche (App. vl), and the re·issus

of the London Conclusions (App. Ν.) Of the mistakes,
which are not very numerous, several seem to be duc
to the excessivc use of contractione in the original
from which it was taken.

All these manuscripts appear to have been written
either late in the fourteenth or during the first half
of the filleenth century.

G is Oleop. a 11. in the Cottonian collection. It
contains a number of documenta, most of them in
writing of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
and relating to the history of the English church
Bp. Wilkins made considerable use ofit sorbis Oon·
cilia. In it are' Arehbishop Courtney’s letter (p. 275),
and the Lollard Conclusions (p. ' 360). Of these thc
former is copied from some unknown source, but its
readings are not important ; the latter bears every
mark of being a copy from our manuscript rh Sec
especially the various readings on pp. 362, 363.

L represents the archiepiscopal registers at Lambeth.
