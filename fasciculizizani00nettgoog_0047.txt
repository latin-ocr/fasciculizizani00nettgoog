tainly contemporaneous They are in tha same general
form, have the same introduction‚ use in substance the
sarna argument3 but that given by Wals'rngham is, of the
two, couchcd irr the more popular language. The other,

, if the inscription may be trusted, was presented to

parliament It would seem tc remain, therefore, that
Walsingham’s must have been intended for general cir·
culation, unless, which I incline to believe, the author
of the Fasciculi has confused the two, so that Wal-

singham's was laid before parliament, and the other
intended probably for distribution among the clergy,
especially in the university.

This would fix the issue of these two traots pretty dcli·
nitcly tc the latter half of October; the date of the other
(p. 481) is not easily ascertained. In the first place ve
carr only guess when the bulls reached this country ;
when they arrived many motives may have delayed
their publication ;¹ and that the delays ware irr fact con·
siderable may be inferred from the date of the letter
sent by Sudbury and Courtney to the chancellor of
Oxford. Tuming to the paper ifself, we find that it
vas issued as an anonymous, or more strictly, a pseudo-
nyrnous pamphlct3 that it speaks of a controversy on
the subject of the papal bulls having already taken place
between Wyclif and a certain “medley” doctor;2 and it
sacras oleru that it was issued at a pause in the dis·
cussion, when Wyclif felt the necessity for a rejoinder,
for which bo yet found 'it difficult to obtain an operr-
irrg. arrd so hit orr the expedient of writing in the
cluuurtor of a third person On the whole, then, ve
may rurncludc, 1 think, that it aas written later than
tho othcr twa, but before the letter to the chancellor.
